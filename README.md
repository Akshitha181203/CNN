# CNN-based Binary Image Classifier using TensorFlow
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to perform binary image classification. The model is trained on a custom dataset and achieves strong performance with accuracy reaching **88.89% on validation** and **80.00% on test data**.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized in the following format:

Dataset_Lab/
â”œâ”€â”€ Dataset/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ class_1/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ class_2/
â””â”€â”€ test/
â”œâ”€â”€ class_1/
â””â”€â”€ class_2/


- `Dataset/` â€” Contains the full dataset used for training and validation (240 images across 2 classes).
- `test/` â€” Contains 20 images used for evaluating the model after training.

## Key Features

- Clean and modular code using `tf.data` API for efficient data loading and prefetching.
- Normalization using `Rescaling(1./255)` layer.
- Dropout layer to mitigate overfitting.
- Prefetching with `AUTOTUNE` for performance optimization.
- Visualization of training/validation curves.
- Evaluation on a separate test dataset.

---

## How to Run

1. Upload the dataset to your Google Drive under `Dataset_Lab/`
2. Mount Google Drive in Colab
3. Run the script to:
   - Load and split the dataset
   - Normalize and prefetch data
   - Build and train the CNN model
   - Plot accuracy/loss graphs
   - Evaluate on the test set

## Future Improvements

- Add data augmentation (e.g., rotation, flipping).
- Introduce early stopping and model checkpointing.
- Hyperparameter tuning (batch size, optimizer, learning rate).
